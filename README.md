# Credit Card Customer Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains Power BI dashboards designed to analyze credit card customer data. The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of key metrics related to revenue, customer demographics, transaction patterns, and more.

## Overview

The dashboards aim to provide actionable insights into credit card customer behavior, enabling stakeholders to understand revenue drivers, customer segments, and transaction characteristics. By visualizing this data, we can identify trends, opportunities, and potential areas for improvement.

## Key Dashboards and Insights

Based on the provided reports, here are some of the key areas covered and potential insights:

**1. Credit Card Customer Report:**

* **Revenue Performance:** This dashboard tracks the sum of revenue over different quarters (Q1-Q4) and provides an overall view. It also breaks down revenue by week, allowing for the identification of peak and low-performing periods.
* **Customer Demographics:** Insights into revenue generated by different age groups (20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60+), customer jobs (Blue-collar, Businessman, Govt, Retirees, Self-employed, White-collar), gender (Male, Female), card type (Gold, Silver, Blue, Platinum), marital status (Married, Single, Unknown), dependent count, and education level. This allows for the identification of high-value customer segments.
* **Income and Interest:** The dashboard also presents the sum of income and total interest earned, providing a financial perspective on customer contributions.
* **Geographic Distribution:** The "Top 5 States" visualization highlights the states with the highest revenue generation.

**Potential Insights:**

* Identify which customer segments (based on age, job, education, etc.) contribute the most to revenue.
* Understand the revenue trends across different quarters and weeks.
* Analyze the relationship between customer income and revenue generation.
* Determine the performance of different card categories.
* Identify key geographic markets.

**2. Credit Card Transaction Report:**

* **Transaction Volume and Amount:** This dashboard focuses on transaction metrics, including the sum of total transaction amount and the count of transactions.
* **Revenue Breakdown:** Similar to the Customer Report, this dashboard also shows the sum of revenue but potentially with a focus on transaction-related attributes.
* **Channel Analysis:** Insights into revenue generated through different transaction channels (Swipe, Chip, Online).
* **Expenditure Analysis:** The "Revenue by Expenditure type" visualization categorizes spending (Bills, Entertainment, Fuel, Grocery, Food, Travel), offering a view into how customers are using their credit cards.

**Potential Insights:**

* Understand the preferred transaction methods of customers.
* Analyze spending patterns across different expenditure categories.
* Compare revenue generated versus the total transaction amount.
* Identify any correlations between card category and transaction behavior.

## How to Use These Dashboards

To utilize these dashboards, you will need:

1.  **Power BI Desktop:** Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine.
2.  **Data Connection (Potentially):** The dashboards are currently based on the data embedded within the PBIX files. If you need to connect to a live data source or refresh the data, you will need the appropriate credentials and connection details.
